# Project eAST

## Overview
Project eAST (eA simulation toolkit) is led by Makoto Asai (SLAC), Geant4 project leader and deep technical expert for more than twenty years, and builds on the work done in existing detector simulations for the EIC. To ease leveraging new and rapidly evolving computing technologies, we are implementing a common and integrated approach for fast and full detector simulations in Geant4 with a plug and play modular approach.
